                            When my dev senses kick-in I build presumably awesome stuff. I stay close to the community and try to keep tabs with the pace at which the web is evolving. I also like to blog what I learn.
                            I built this site from scratch. By scratch, I mean absolutely from scratch without any UI library/framework (except React though) and had so much fun along the way.
                            React-Redux, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and PostgresSQL are the main tricks up my sleeve. I am also obsessed with making the web look pretty with CSS.
